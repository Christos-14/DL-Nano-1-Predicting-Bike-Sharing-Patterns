# Udacity - Deep Learning Nanodegree

## Project 1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Data

In this project, I built a neural network from scratch using Pytorch, trained it on a bike rental dataset provided by udacity and used it to predict daily bike rental ridership.

The main artefacts are:

-**my_answers.py** : Python script with my NN implementation.

-**Your_first_neural_network.ipynb** : Jupuyter notebook that goes through the process, 
including loading and pre-processing data, building and training the NN, making predictions and visualizing the results.
